# fun
Games of educational use, e.g. jigsaw puzzle
Any picture in png format can be used. Just have to adapt the name in the HTML file, and if wished change the number of columns, number of rows in the Puzzle
I didnt find any glitches.

i would like to make a proper HTML page where children can choose the picture and choose the nb of pieces(approximately)
